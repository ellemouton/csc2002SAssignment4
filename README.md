Hi!

Please use the command "make" to compile all the necessary files.
Then type "java TreeGrow sample_imput.txt" to run the program.

When the GUI starts, press the "Reset button". The buttons reaction times are slow so give it about 5 seconds to respond. The same goes for the other buttons.

I have also made the pause button such that the play button must first be pressed before any of the buttons work again. So just make sure you press "Play" after you press "Pause" if you want to use the other buttons.
